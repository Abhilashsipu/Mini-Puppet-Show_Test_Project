# Mini-Puppet-Show_Test_Project
Hello EVeryone,
      I, Abhilash Mishra, along with my batch-mates have tried to recreate a puppet show using Arduino UNO and servo motors. This is just a test project, as here we have not implemented the feel of a real puppet show by adding lights, sounds and other creative items to the project.
